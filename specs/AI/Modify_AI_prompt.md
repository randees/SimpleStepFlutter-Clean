# NEW feature Custom AI prompt added to the AI/MCP testing widget
## I want to be able to change the system prompt that I'm sending to AI.
- Right above the Select User Context Please add a Textfield that displays the default system prompt getting sent to the AI.  I would like this to be editable. And have a button that will reset the text in this field back to the default the system is using.
- At The bottom create a new button next to the "Ask AI" Button.  I want it to say "Ask AI Custom".  
- If they click the "Ask AI Cutom" Button it uses the custom system prompt in the text area.  
- The current "Ask AI" button should still use the default System prompt provided in code.
