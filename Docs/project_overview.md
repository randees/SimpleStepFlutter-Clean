# Simple Step Flutter - Project Overview

## App Description

This is a proof-of-concept Flutter application that reads step count data from Health Connect on Android devices and HealthKit on iOS devices, displaying it on a simple white screen with black numbers.

## Features Implemented

✅ White screen background  
✅ Black number display for step count  
✅ **Cross-platform health integration** (Health Connect + HealthKit)  
✅ No data simulation - real data only  
✅ Graceful error handling  
✅ Display 0 when no data available  
✅ Minimal feature set as requested  
✅ Permission checking and requests (both platforms)  
✅ Debug information display with platform detection  
✅ Platform-specific retry functionality  
✅ **NEW: Supabase database integration for data storage**  
✅ **NEW: Date range selection for historical data sync (90 days)**  
✅ **NEW: Duplicate prevention (skips existing data)**  
✅ **NEW: Cross-platform data sync to PostgreSQL database**  

## Project Requirements Met

1. ✅ **Development Stack**: Flutter with Dart (cross-platform)
2. ✅ **Display**: White screen with black numbers (step count)
3. ✅ **No Simulation**: Only real health data (Health Connect/HealthKit)
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors and missing data
5. ✅ **Documentation**: All docs in "Docs" folder
6. ✅ **Git Files**: .gitignore included
7. ✅ **Same Directory**: Project created in same directory as copilot_instructions.md
8. ✅ **Launch Instructions**: README.md contains program launch instructions
9. ✅ **iOS Support**: Added HealthKit integration for iOS devices

## Dependencies Used

- `health: ^13.1.1` - Cross-platform health data integration (Health Connect + HealthKit)
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.5.6` - Database integration for step data storage
- `intl: ^0.19.0` - Date formatting and internationalization

## Quick Start

1. Connect Android device or start emulator
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to launch the app
4. Grant Health Connect permissions when prompted
5. View your step count displayed on the white screen

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or development, refer to the following documentation:

- **`Docs/troubleshooting_guide.md`** - Health Connect/HealthKit permission issues and solutions
- **`Docs/supabase_setup_guide.md`** - Step-by-step Supabase database setup
- **`Docs/supabase_integration.md`** - Technical details of database integration

### Common Issue Categories:

- Gradle wrapper corruption
- MinSdk version conflicts  
- Health Connect permission problems
- Flutter health plugin compatibility issues
- Build failures and debugging techniques
- **NEW: Supabase connection and configuration issues**
- **NEW: Database sync and duplicate handling problems**

## Notes

- **Android**: Requires device with Health Connect support (Android 8.0+ / API 26+)
- **iOS**: Requires device with HealthKit support (iOS 8.0+)
- Permissions must be granted for step data access on both platforms
- Real step data only - no simulation or fake data
- Minimal UI as requested in specifications
- Debug information displayed on screen showing current platform
- Platform-specific troubleshooting and manual setup instructions
- Retry button available if permissions fail on either platform
